# RSA encryption and decryption
Simple Java program to demonstrate RSA encryption and decryption using a constructor and tester. Currently limited to 117 byte input. Tester asks for user input until Q for quit. Output returns sealedObject and decrypted message which is expected to be the original message. <br>
This is for demonstration purposes only and could be implemented for server communication. Benefits of RSA also include the authentication of the sender, especially important for server communication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
